# Least-Square-GAN
My implementation of least square gan

# Notice

a. Within same epochs, the Pearson divergence loss converges much slower than the none-Pearson divergence loss.

b. The Pearson divergence version could generate more real images rather than color disstortion of none-Pearson version.

c. Don't use a activation at the output of generator logits.

d. Batch Norm Will Speed Up the convergence.
